            <h1>Rescue Power Rangers</h1>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Rescue Power Rangers, introduced in 2003, are a team of Power Rangers dedicated to saving people and fighting evil. Led by Carter Grayson, the team consists of five members who use advanced fire and rescue-themed equipment and vehicles to protect the city and the world from disasters and villainous threats. The team includes Carter, Chad, Kelsey, Dana, and Max, who are trained in emergency response and use their rescue skills to fight evil and save lives. Their powerful Zords, like the fire truck, allow them to battle enemies and rescue citizens from danger while ensuring peace and safety in the city.</p>
