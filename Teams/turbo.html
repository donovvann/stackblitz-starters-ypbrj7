            <h1>Turbo Power Rangers</h1>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Turbo Rangers were the successors of the Zeo Rangers, introduced in 1997. This team was tasked with defending Earth against Divatox, a space pirate. The team initially consisted of Tommy, Kat, Adam, Tanya, and Justin, who was the first child Ranger. They used the power of turbo-charged vehicles and their Turbo Morphers to fight evil and embarked on adventures that spanned both land and sea.</p>
