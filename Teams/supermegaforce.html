            <h1>Super Megaforce Power Rangers</h1>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Super Megaforce Power Rangers, introduced in 2014, are the follow-up team to the Megaforce Rangers. The team gains new abilities as they unlock the legendary powers of past Rangers. Led again by Troy Burrows, the team faces the challenge of stopping the evil forces of the Armada, led by the villainous Emperor Mavro. They are tasked with saving Earth and the entire universe, using the power of previous Ranger teams to fight against increasingly dangerous foes. The Super Megaforce Rangers also gain the ability to transform into past Ranger teams, creating a powerful force of combined legacies.</p>
