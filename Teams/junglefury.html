            <h1>Jungle Fury Power Rangers</h1>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Jungle Fury Power Rangers, introduced in 2008, are a team of Rangers who derive their powers from animal spirits. The team is led by Casey Rhodes, a martial artist who becomes the Red Ranger. Together with his teammates, Lily and Theo, they use the power of animal spirits to fight against the evil forces of Dai Shi. The Rangers must also learn the ways of the ancient Jungle Fury style of combat to harness the full potential of their powers. Alongside their spiritual journey, they battle powerful enemies and protect the Earth from destruction.</p>
