            <h1>Dino Thunder Power Rangers</h1>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Dino Thunder Power Rangers, introduced in 2004, are a team of Rangers who draw their powers from ancient dinosaurs. Led by Dr. Tommy Oliver, a former Green Ranger, the team consists of Conner, Kira, and Ethan, who are chosen to fight against the evil forces of Mesogog. The Rangers use powerful Dino Morphers and Dino Zords, which are based on prehistoric creatures, to protect the Earth from Mesogogâ€™s evil plans. The team must also deal with the challenge of balancing their high school lives while defending the world from extinction-level threats.</p>
